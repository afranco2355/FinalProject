# NYC Subway Accessibility Map

## Overview
The NYC Subway Accessibility Map is a web application that displays information about subway stations in New York City and their accessibility infrastructure. It aims to highlight the efforts of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in improving accessibility across the subway system to accommodate people with disabilities or other physical limitations. Currently, only approximately 20% of stations are accessible, despite a population of almost a million people with disabilities in the entire city.

This project provides a visual representation of subway stations, indicating whether they have accessibility infrastructure such as elevators and escalators. By making this information readily available and easily accessible, we hope to raise awareness about the importance of improving accessibility in public transportation and advocating for further enhancements to the subway system.

## Features
- Interactive map interface displaying subway stations across NYC.
- Markers indicating accessibility status (e.g., accessible, partially accessible, not accessible).
- Filter options to view stations based on accessibility features.
- Detailed information about each station, including accessibility amenities available.
- Integration with real-time weather data to provide additional context for users.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to address the significant disparity in accessibility within the NYC subway system. Despite the city's vast public transportation network, a large portion of the population, including people with disabilities, face challenges in accessing it. By visualizing accessibility information, we aim to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their travel routes and advocate for further improvements in accessibility infrastructure.
