                <p>The project is dedicated to enhancing accessibility across the transit system, with a focus on
                    initiatives outlined in the MTA's 2020-2024 Capital Program. This program allocates a historic $5.2
                    billion towards making stations newly accessible, alongside an additional nearly $600 million designated
                    for elevator upgrades to enhance reliability.</p>
                <p>Utilizing these funds, the project aims to render certain subway stations newly accessible while
                    implementing elevator replacements and other enhancements to ensure reliability and safety. Upon
                    completion, subway riders will find accessible stations within a maximum of two stops' distance.</p>
                <p>Progress has already commenced, with accessibility upgrades underway at 21 stations across the five
                    boroughs, and elevator replacement projects recently finalized at eight stations, with ongoing efforts
                    throughout the system. The Rapid Station Accessibility Upgrade program is facilitating some of these
                    improvements through collaboration with a private partner tasked with expedited and cost-effective
                    execution, alongside a 15-year maintenance commitment for the elevators.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the 57 St F station is slated for accessibility enhancements under the Zoning for
                    Accessibility program, established through a partnership with New York City and private developers.</p>
                <p>Moreover, a landmark agreement announced in 2022 between the MTA and accessibility advocates solidifies
                    the commitment to systemwide accessibility, outlining a clear trajectory towards achieving 95%
                    accessibility by 2055. Strategic decisions regarding station prioritization for accessibility
                    improvements are made in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and through
                    consultation with riders and advocates to maximize the project's impact.</p>
